# Hi there, my name's Bram

### Who am I?
I am an ex-academic philosopher turned network engineer & software developer.

I have experience working with enterprise network technologies ranging from switches, NGINX, firewalls, and security systems.

I am continuing to learn and strengthen my skills as a software developer focusing on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Swift.

When I am not directly learning about web development I am an active Game Boy hacker working with assembly for the Game Boy and Game Boy Color.

### My goals
I am currently looking for an entry role in web development.

### Projects
1. I built a simple tally counter for iOS which is available [here](https://github.com/PaperFloppyDisk/TallyTracker)

### Other Stuff
I am fluent in English, German and am currently learning Hebrew.
